        <div class="paragraph" id="introduction1" style="pointer-events: auto;">Technology is not neutral. From
          structure to interface design, digital
          spaces are shaped by the same structures of power that are dominant in the physical world – patriarchy,
          capitalism, and colonialism. Historically, dominated by masculine frameworks, technological development has
          prioritised efficiency, power, and control over access and inclusivity. This has led to digital
          infrastructures that often alienate and exclude those who do not conform to dominant norms, particularly women
          and people of colour. In response, cyberfeminism emerged as a critical framework in the 1990s, offering both a
          critique of these systems and a vision for alternative digital futures. </div>
        <div class="paragraph" id="introduction2">While early cyberfeminist movements were limited by their
          predominantly Western and academic lens, they opened essential questions about gender, power, and digital
          space. Today, as we live in the post-digital world, these questions feel more urgent than ever. As the
          Internet becomes increasingly corporatised many artists, designers, and creatives are turning to communal,
          "softer" practices, such as hand-coded websites, experimental design, and digital gardening to imagine
          different ways of being "online". These approaches challenge the dominant narratives of scale, optimisation,
          and perfection instead of embracing slowness, play, care, and co-creation. </div>
        <div class="paragraph" id="introduction3">My critical report analyses the question: How can cyberfeminism,
          combined with communal softer practices, contribute to a more inclusive technological future? To explore this,
          I begin by examining how feminist theory critiques gendered foundations of technology, then consider how early
          internet cultures embodied communal values now largely lost in the age of algorithmic platforms. Finally, I
          draw from my own creative research to propose that digital spaces need to prioritise intent rather than impact
          and be shaped by feminist ethics combined with soft practices. These frameworks can model new modes of digital
          belonging, ones that prioritise representation, mutual support, and collective authorship over extraction and
          control. </div>

          All technology reflects the current state of the world including power structures and prejustice. Historically
          rooted in patriarchy and capitalism, many technological systems are built upon hierarchical, top-down models
          that prioritise control, efficiency, and profit. This makes them structurally rigid and resistant to change,
          slow to adapt to diverse needs, and often unable to accommodate non-normative identities or experiences. These

          explores how technology is deeply embedded in a
          masculine framework, arguing that it’s not just a tool or a neutral force but a social and symbolic domain
          heavily shaped by gender, specifically values associated with masculinity. Wajcman argues that the very idea
          of technology is culturally coded as masculine. From the language used to describe tech (mastery, domination,
          control) to the industries that dominate its development (engineering, military), technology has been
          historically associated with male power and authority. Women aren’t just excluded from technology due to a
          lack of skills or opportunities, they’re also culturally alienated from it. The masculine identity of
          technical fields creates a symbolic barrier that makes it difficult for women to feel a sense of belonging or
          legitimacy. Judy Wajcman concludes that simply adding women into existing technological structures isn’t
          enough. What’s
          needed is a transformation of the masculine culture of technology itself, including rethinking design values,
          education, and what counts as a technical competence.

          It's no surprise many women choose to leave the industry, but their participation is crucial. We've seen the

        <div class="paragraph">
          In order to find ways of challenging the culture around tech to encourage women to engage with technology, I
          decided to speak with women working in creative tech about what they feel is currently lacking. Rifke Sadleir,
          a creative technologist, pointed out that representation is crucial, not just through imagery or text, but
          through the visibility of women actively creating, experimenting, and generating ideas.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">This conversation made me reflect on the communal aspect of the tech. Mainstream tech
          often values efficiency, perfection, and profit over experimentation and creativity. This environment can be
          alienating, especially for newcomers. It's difficult to engage with computing if you don't already have
          experience, and the patriarchal culture surrounding tech often leaves women with little room to make mistakes.

        <div class="paragraph">The main intent of the project is to create a space that shows that computing and coding
          don't always have to be rigid and serious. It can be playful, it can be unfinished, it can be silly. I want to
          show that coding projects are mostly exploratory and evolving. By highlighting women and gender-diverse
          individuals engaging with technology in creative and artistic ways, the project challenges narrow stereotypes
          of who a "tech person" can be. I also aim to demystify the notion that coding is a closed or exclusive
          skillset. By making computation more approachable, my project encourages experimentation.

        <div class="h3">03 CYBERFEMINISM AS A CRITICAL FRAMEWORK </div>
      </div>

      <div class="text">
        <div class="paragraph">
          In 1994, a cultural theorist Sadie Plant coined the term "Cyberfeminism", it looks at online spaces as a
          world-building tool and challenges patriarchal hegemony. It's linked to the idea of using the Internet to
          resist traditional power structures, particularly those that dominate offline, everyday life.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          However, the early development of cyberfeminism had limitations. Much like earlier feminist movements in the
          physical world, early cyberfeminism often reflected white, Western, and academic perspectives. It borrowed
          language and attitudes from first and second-wave feminism, which were criticised for excluding people of
          colour, queer people, and trans people. Critics, including scholars like Lisa Nakamura and Judy Wajcman, have
          pointed out that

          does not sufficiently address how race, colonial history, and class shape women's relationships with
          technology. Her cyberfeminism is seen as being rooted in a Eurocentric and techno-utopian vision that neglects
          these important dimensions. Plant's writing often treats technology as an autonomous force that will
          inevitably liberate women. Intersectional feminism, by contrast, argues that technology is shaped by social,
          cultural, and political power structures, which can reproduce inequality if not critically examined. As a
          result, cyberfeminism initially failed to fully include global and intersectional voices, and digital spaces
          began to mirror real-world exclusions reproducing a "white cyberspace" shaped by white feminist theory.

          </span>
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          Even though some groups like the Old Boys' Network, Subrosa, and VNS Matrix worked to expand these ideas and
          include perspectives on race and colonialism, the most visible faces of cyberfeminism remained predominantly
          white. This highlighted how digital utopias could still carry the same exclusionary politics as the offline
          world. Despite these problems, cyberfeminism introduced the idea that feminism could engage with technology
          not just as a tool but as something to be critiqued and shaped. It encouraged feminists to think about how
          power, gender, capitalism, and control operate within digital systems, and how these systems are built by
          people with their own biases.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          Cyberfeminism provides a way to challenge patriarchal narratives in technology by questioning and reshaping
          the culture around it. Instead of relying on corporate-owned platforms like traditional forums and social
          media, cyberfeminism encourages creating
          alternative digital spaces, archives, and networks. Cyberfeminism also advocates for changing the way we learn
          and share knowledge online. It moves away from traditional, hierarchical models of teaching, promoting
          decentralised, peer-to-peer networks that are more accessible, inclusive, and welcoming. Additionally,
          cyberfeminism emphasises the importance of documenting creative processes and experimental practices. By
          openly sharing the creative process, cyberfeminist approaches demystify technology and encourage more people
          to engage with it. In doing so, cyberfeminism doesn't just critique existing tech infrastructures, it actively
          offers alternative ways to interact with and reimagine digital spaces through a feminist lens.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          My project’s interface and computation logic hand-coded and personalised is an active manifestation of
          cyberfeminist principles that reject cultural notions around technology and how it's supposed to look like.
          The DIY principle emphasises creative labour and contrasts sharply with corporately dominated spaces. The
          visitor is navigated not with efficiency, but with genuine curiosity. The visuals and interactions reflect a
          refusal to flatten digital space into binary logic, instead opening space for ambiguity and multiple
          experiences of being online. This reinforces the idea that cyberfeminism isn't just about who uses technology,
          but how we collectively imagine and shape the culture.

          While exploring how I can challenge culture around technology, I found myself turning towards the early
          Internet. Not only as a nostalgic memory but a forgotten model of communal Internet. Before the Internet
          became a platform for commerce, influence, and algorithmic control, it was a space defined by raw
          experimentation, personal expression, and DIY spirit.

          allowed users to create their webpages, organised into themed "neighbourhoods" like Hollywood, SiliconValley,
          or Tokyo. These weren't just categories, they created a virtual cityscape that made the Web feel less like a
          sea of isolated pages and more like a community of neighbours with shared interests.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          In analysing early web communities like GeoCities, I've observed radically different values – openness,
          experimentation, imperfection, and mutual care. Unlike today's user experience (UX) patterns that prioritise
          uniformity and speed, GeoCities fostered visual diversity and emotional authorship. Users didn't need to code
          perfectly, instead, they learned by sharing messy HTML pages filled with GIFs, gradients, and bright banners.
          GeoCities was a place for digital self-expression, its lack of templates encouraged individuality. The design
          wasn't dictated by market-tested frameworks but by curiosity and play. In this way, it supported a kind of
          soft digital literacy, where users weren't just consuming content, but shaping the structure of the Web
          itself.

          which helped to introduce GeoCities to a younger audience. Their archive is not just nostalgic
          documentation, but an act of resistance. Their practice can be described as a race to reclaim internet history
          before the corporate Internet completely erased it. Some see old GeoCities sites as a form of folk art, not
          polished or commercial, but deeply personal and expressive.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          The founder of GeoCities David Bohnett said: "GeoCities was not about self-promotion; it was about sharing
          your interest and your knowledge." The early Web had a tight feeling of community, and all the visual
          "clichés" helped to form it. For example – GIFS, a lot of them were made transparent, because they were meant
          to be shared.

          The values of the early Web – playful exploration, open knowledge sharing, and collaboration mirror many
          cyberfeminist aspirations. Communal ethics of the early Web paired with a feminist lens that critiques power

          windows in this kind of structure. And there are no walls. The Internet is not dead. It is undead, and it's

          provides vastly different experiences for every user depending on their location, identity, and political
          circumstances. Steyerl suggests that digital technologies don't just affect what we see on screens - they
          infiltrate the material world. Computation is no longer confined to computers; it exists in infrastructure and
          objects. For instance, smart devices, algorithm policing, and facial recognition technology. "Moreover, it is
          not only form that migrates across screens, but also function. Computation and connectivity permeate matter
          and render it as raw material for algorithmic prediction, or potentially also as building blocks for alternate
          networks." Essentially, living in the post-internet world, we can see how boundaries between digital and
          physical are dissolving, and everything is turned into data. Something that was once seen as a free exchange
          space is now filled with harmful algorithms that reinforce the interests of data-driven capitalism.

          This historical lineage is central to my project. Rather than borrowing the early Web's visuals as an
          aesthetic trend, I draw from its structural and social values, particularly the idea of digital
          neighbourhoods. These were not just metaphors but frameworks that actively encouraged connection,
          self-expression, and mutual care. My project reinterprets these models to create a non-hierarchical, communal
          digital space that prioritise visibility, collaboration, and emotional safety. Inspired by the way GeoCities
          organised users into virtual neighbourhoods, where people with shared interests coexisted, created, and learnt
          from each other. I use this structure to foster a feminist, community-led environment. Similarly, the metaphor
          of the digital garden informs the soft, evolving nature of the space. It grows slowly, values process over
          perfection, and invites users to co-create. In doing so, I aim to restore the communal spirit of the early
          Internet, not through nostalgic design but through the intentional architecture of belonging.

          propose slow technology as a design philosophy that shifts focus from efficiency to reflection. They argue
          that
          with the digitalisation of our everyday life, technology should not only optimise tasks but also create space
          for contemplation. Technology can be slow in various ways:
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          i) takes time to learn how it works, <br> ii) takes time to understand why it works the way it works, <br>
          iii) takes time to apply it,<br> iv) takes time to see what it is, <br> v) takes time to find out the
          consequences of using it.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
          This slowness may come from the complexity of the design, but it also can be intentional slowness in learning
          and understanding (i and ii) and in the presence (iii, iv, and v) of a work of art, a piece of music or any
          other object designed for reflection. “When we use something purely as an efficient tool, time disappears – we
          get things done. But when we engage with the design that invites reflection, time becomes noticeable as we are
          present in the moment” (Hallnäs &amp; Redström, 2002).
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">I believe that adopting softer and slower approaches in digital is crucial to gradually
          move towards inclusive, community-oriented technical spaces. By intentionally slowing down, we give time to
          absorb and understand new knowledge, which also makes learning more accessible and less overwhelming. In doing
          so, we not only demystify technology but also create an environment where creativity and new ideas can
          flourish. A slower approach values the aesthetic and reflective dimensions of technology, which transforms it
          from a tool into an object of experience and connection. </div>
        <div class="paragraph">My project aims to foster softer approaches. Rather than guiding a user toward certain
          outcomes or gamified achievements, the garden fosters space for stillness and reflection. The softness is
          visualised through colours and animations, which welcomes visitors to engage with the space. However, softness
          is not only an aesthetic but the structures of interactions that encourage the visitor to engage with space at
          their own pace. Simple animations, special sounds and calming colour palette invite visitors in the experience
          of attentiveness. </div>

          I began to see digital spaces not as a static product, but as living environments that evolve with their
          community. For example, a room - a comforting, finite space that can be rearranged to suit the purpose of
          communal Internet.

        <div class="paragraph">Mainstream tech operates on a logic of scalability. A platform is "successful" if it can
          rapidly expand its user base. Growth is equated with legitimacy and value. A common critique of the communal
          internets is the lack of ability to expand because it challenges the narrative of scalability and efficiency.
          But this critique often misunderstands their purpose.

        <div class="paragraph">Caroline Sinders and Trammell Hudson, creators of Potato Internet, challenge this by
          asking "What if the future of the internet is all about scaling down?", their project shows that a functioning
          network can be built using small-scale, anti-extractive, and sustainable methods. Communal spaces don't fail
          to scale, they choose to grow differently, centring "care" over mass market success. Their values lie not in
          how big they get, but in how meaningfully they support those within them.

          In the age of infinite content that somehow feels the same because of trends and rigid algorithms, I believe
          that slowing down can be about recovering physical space in a digital framework. A space that is finite, where
          a visitor will be able to explore and critically engage with ideas, with a space to reflect. As Virginia Woolf

          "a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction," and "that the absence of female
          fiction is a result of a lack of opportunity rather than a distinct absence of talent." Woolf's metaphor can
          be used to argue that the absence of women's creative computational output is not due to the lack of talent,
          but a lack of opportunity and space. My project takes this metaphor "online", proposing what a "room" might
          look like for women creative technologists today.

          gardening is not about specific tools, but a completely different way to think about our digital behavior. He
          reframed it as an alternative to the "stream" – a fleeting feed of social media and envisioned gardens as
          spaces for slow thinking, learning, and curating knowledge - Internet-based communal spaces that foster ideas
          and experiences.

          of technological mastery and production. Rather than displaying authority, gardens often include uncertainty,

          Gardens encourage co-authorship and public learning, often including sections like "notes", "progress" or

          others to learn and build from them. This is a model of interaction, where users don't compete for attention,

          This project is a

          uncover conversations, personal notes, ASCII art, confessions, or quiet poetry. This site is always changing,
          there is no archive or profiles, it's just open space for expression.

        <div class="paragraph">
          Each visitor has the same level of control with no hierarchy. This openness creates room for spontaneous

          built on simple code and text, its interface invites a slow, reflective type of interaction. It feels gentle.

          Badr's project shows how digital tools can create a connection not through hyper-efficiency or monetisation,
          but through shared space, co-authorship, and vulnerability. Messages are left for unknown others, or even just
          for the pleasure of being witnessed. This turns the act of writing into an offering rather than a broadcast.
          It shows that even the simplest web structure, when designed without hierarchies or commercial intent, can
          create room for meaningful expression and unexpected care.

          Digital gardening has directly informed both the metaphor and structure of my project. Like a garden, my site
          grows organically through user submissions and changes over time. It avoids centralised feeds, replacing them
          with exploratory navigation. The interface invites communal authorship through participatory tools that
          decentralises control over content. Cyber garden visualises the metaphor of a community garden.

        <div class="paragraph">
          This practice is deeply rooted in British culture, which has been historically places that form communities

          ideas, resources, and inspiration. Flowers differ in shape and colour, which symbolises the diversity of the
          space. The visuals are also a metaphor for confronting digital urbanisation (corporate dominance), and
          prioritising connection and visualised contributions of several gardeners. The experience of being in the
          garden is one of cohabitation rather than consumption, it resists isolated browsing in favour of collective

          In addressing my research question, the final output offers a tangible digital prototype rooted in feminist

          cultures, which marginalise diversity and prioritise profit over empathy. The space denies linear social media
          narratives and treats each submission equally. By designing spaces that invite softness, communal

          resist rigid categorising. These elements reflect a commitment to designing with rather than for marginalised
          communities, offering not a finished product, but an adaptable framework. As a designer, through the metaphor
          of growing a garden, I want to illustrate that inclusivity is not a feature set, but an evolving rational
          ethic. This signals a future where digital spaces are shaped by the pluralities of those who inhabit them.

          Throughout this report, I have analysed cyberfeminist and softer approaches that can contribute to a more

          Caulfield, and other writers and designers, I have visualised softer communal space dedicated for sharing. By
          prioritising empathy and care, these practices challenge dominant narratives and offer digital space combined

          Moving forward, my aim is to continue designing specifically for women. In a technological world primarily
